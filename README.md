Forward filtering backward smoothing algorithm of Durbin and Koopman (2002)

This respository contains functions for the Kalman filter algorithm proposed in Durbin and Koopman (2002).

It requires the <code>mvtnorm</code> package to draw from multivariate Normal Distributions.

The function <code>dk.alg2</code> generates the $latex $y^+$ $
